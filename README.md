# covid-data-analysis

Using a Microsoft SQL server, I created a local SQL server on my computer. I then pulled the World Health Organisation Covid dataset and queried it using SQL. I then created 'views' of those queries and brought those into Tableau to create visualisations. 

My Tableau dashboard can be found here - https://public.tableau.com/views/Covidportfolioproject_16957707745070/WHOCovidDatauntil4thofSeptember2023?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
